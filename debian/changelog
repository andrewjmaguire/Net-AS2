libnet-as2-perl (1.0-1) stable; urgency=low

  * HTTP::Headers
    - Accept an HTTP::Headers compatible object for the headers parameter in
      decode_message() and decode_mdn(). A hash ref is also still accepted.

  * Update POD documentation

  * Packaging
    - Use and configure Dist::Zilla
    - Review POD style
    - Fix POD content errors

  * File options
    - Enable private key and certificates to be read in from files

  * HTTPS support
    - Enable UserAgent class to be configured
    - Provide support for sending requests over HTTPS

  * Enable SHA-2 support
    - Use Digest::SHA to provide support for sha1 and sha2 signing.
      SHA-2 is not officially part of the AS2 RFC specification but
      is commonly implemented in AS2 implementations.

  * Bugfixes to ensure communication compatibility
    - Tested communication with as2-server
    - Tested communication with RSSBus

  * Miscellaneous
    - Remove trailing whitespace
    - Remove use of experimental smartmatch feature
    - minor corrections of POD
    - Split up tests so that older Perl versions pass.
      This avoids some memory leak with Crypt::SMIME.
    - Add 2019 copyright
    - Update Maintainer information
